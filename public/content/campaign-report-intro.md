## ðŸ“Š Campaign Performance Overview

I dove deep into our Google Ads data from the past month, and I'm seeing some clear patterns we can leverage. We've generated 268 clicks and 16 conversions at a total cost of $1,278.25. Our overall conversion rate stands at 5.97%, with an average cost per conversion of $79.89 - not bad, but definitely room for improvement.

Mobile is our powerhouse, driving a whopping 87.5% of all conversions despite only accounting for 70% of our spend. That's a signal we can't ignore. Sunday and Wednesday are our engagement hotspots, and evenings (6-8 PM) consistently deliver our best performance, with a secondary bump during the late morning (10-11 AM).

The data is telling us a story - we've got solid foundations but several quick dial turns could immediately move the needle. Let's feed what's working and cut what's not.

## ðŸš€ Key Takeaways & Next Steps

- **Mobile-first strategy:** Let's shift at least 25-30% more budget toward mobile campaigns. With an 8.19% conversion rate on mobile vs. 3.28% on desktop, and a much lower cost per conversion ($63.93 vs. $188.66), this is our biggest opportunity.

- **Day & time optimization:** Increase bids by 20-30% on Sundays and Wednesdays, particularly during the 6-8 PM window and that 10-11 AM timeframe. We should be aggressive when our audience is most engaged.

- **Keyword refinement:** Our data shows "summer daycare near me" and "summer program" are carrying the weight, but there's a gap between our keywords and what people are actually searching. Let's add "summer camps boston" as an exact match keyword and other missing terms from our top searches.

- **Audience focus:** We're hitting the right demographic - primarily parents in their prime working years (25-44), with a strong female skew (81.19%). Let's tailor our messaging specifically to this audience segment.

- **Weekly testing cycle:** I'd recommend testing 2-3 new ad variations, implementing the device/timing adjustments, and tracking weekly. Cut what underperforms fast, double down on winners.
