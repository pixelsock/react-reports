            <h2>ðŸ“Š Campaign Performance Overview</h2>
            
            <p>I dove deep into our Google Ads data from the past month, and I'm seeing some clear patterns we can leverage. We've generated 268 clicks and 16 conversions at a total cost of $1,278.25. Our overall conversion rate stands at 5.97%, with an average cost per conversion of $79.89 - not bad, but definitely room for improvement.</p>
            
            <p>Mobile is our powerhouse, driving a whopping 87.5% of all conversions despite only accounting for 70% of our spend. That's a signal we can't ignore. Sunday and Wednesday are our engagement hotspots, and evenings (6-8 PM) consistently deliver our best performance, with a secondary bump during the late morning (10-11 AM).</p>
            
            <p>The data is telling us a story - we've got solid foundations but several quick dial turns could immediately move the needle. Let's feed what's working and cut what's not.</p>
            
            <h2>ðŸš€ Key Takeaways & Next Steps</h2>
            
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Mobile-first strategy:</strong> Let's shift at least 25-30% more budget toward mobile campaigns. With an 8.19% conversion rate on mobile vs. 3.28% on desktop, and a much lower cost per conversion ($63.93 vs. $188.66), this is our biggest opportunity.</li>
              
              <li><strong>Day & time optimization:</strong> Increase bids by 20-30% on Sundays and Wednesdays, particularly during the 6-8 PM window and that 10-11 AM timeframe. We should be aggressive when our audience is most engaged.</li>
              
              <li><strong>Keyword refinement:</strong> Our data shows "summer daycare near me" and "summer program" are carrying the weight, but there's a gap between our keywords and what people are actually searching. Let's add "summer camps boston" as an exact match keyword and other missing terms from our top searches.</li>
              
              <li><strong>Audience focus:</strong> We're hitting the right demographic - primarily parents in their prime working years (25-44), with a strong female skew (81.19%). Let's tailor our messaging specifically to this audience segment.</li>
              
              <li><strong>Weekly testing cycle:</strong> I'd recommend testing 2-3 new ad variations, implementing the device/timing adjustments, and tracking weekly. Cut what underperforms fast, double down on winners.</li>
